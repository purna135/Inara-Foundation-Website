Projects

1. Interactive

1.1 ACOINTIER:
 ”Acointier” is a French term that simply translates to, “to introduce oneself.” This project is an interactive initiative that brings together individuals who are unfamiliar with each other to respond to a set of questions. The main objective of Acoinitier is to help people broaden their social connections and comprehend each other’s perspectives, mainly on an emotional level, concerning various aspects of their lives. Additionally, this project aims to inspire individuals to express themselves authentically in front of a small group of people who offer a secure environment to be heard. Since we started the project, Acoinitier has facilitated numerous like-minded individuals to connect and has become increasingly popular among the youth.

1.2 Christmas Celebration at AIIMS
Experience the joy of giving and the magic of life with our heartwarming Christmas celebration alongside the brave little heroes battling cancer at AIIMS Bhubaneswar. This special event featured a day filled with creativity through arts and crafts, spreading smiles with a thoughtful gift-giving session for the children, and creating a harmonious atmosphere with a lively music jamming session. The highlight of the day was the shared delight during the cake-cutting ceremony, symbolizing the sweetness of the moments we cherish.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to AIIMS Bhubaneswar for providing us with this meaningful opportunity. Special thanks to the dedicated volunteers from Inara Foundation and Zomato, whose selfless efforts added an extra layer of warmth and joy to the occasion. These moments not only remind us of the resilience of these young warriors but also emphasize the true magic of life that comes from spreading love and happiness. Join us in celebrating the spirit of giving and creating lasting memories with those who inspire us every day.

1.3 Day of Service - 2024
We had the privilege of participating in the Day of Service on October 2nd 2024, organized by the Bakul Foundation across slums in Odisha. As volunteers of Inara Foundation, we immersed ourselves in a day filled with meaningful interactions with children. Engaging in various forms of art, from finger painting and drawing to coloring and collage-making, we witnessed the creativity of these young minds using materials from magazines and newspapers.

The children not only showcased their artistic talents but also took part in games, singing, and dancing, sharing moments of joy and laughter. This heartwarming experience echoed the success of last year’s event, and we express our gratitude for the opportunity to contribute once again. Looking ahead, we eagerly anticipate future involvements in the Day of Service, cherishing the chance to make a positive impact on the lives of these children.

1.4 Choti Diwali AT FOUNDLING HOMES:
We celebrated Choti Diwali with heartfelt joy as our dedicated volunteers visited a foundling home, creating lasting memories with the children. Engaging in the spirit of creativity, “We painted vibrant diyas, encouraging artistic expression and spreading delight among the young hearts. In line with our commitment to a sustainable Diwali, we distributed sweets, chocolates, and a few sky lanterns, avoiding the use of crackers and emphasizing an eco-friendly celebration and educating about minimizing and gradually putting an end to crackets to celebrate an environment friendly Diwalli.

Children eagerly anticipated lighting up their beautifully painted diyas, turning their space into a radiant and joyous Diwali zone. This wonderful celebration was made possible through the support of ‘Zumba for a Purpose,’ a weekend event that raised funds for art materials and essentials. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who participated and contributed, making this Diwali truly Khushion waali (full of happiness).

2. Fundraiser Projects

2.1 Project Amrit:
In April 2022, the volunteers of Inara resolved to do something for the traffic officers who spend a significant amount of time in scorching weather. Thus, project Amrit was born. Over 25 volunteers participated in the initiative, travelling around Bhubaneswar to distribute juice bottles to traffic officers at various locations. The officers’ response was heartening and Inara received immense support and appreciation from the public to keep doing more. Hence, we intend to undertake similar initiatives every year to promote the message of supporting and appreciating those who work tirelessly for our safety, irrespective of the circumstances.

2.2 Donations for foundling home:
In 2020, Inara Foundation started its journey of fundraising and donations. The first donation was made on November 1st, 2020 to an orphanage that housed 35 boys of various age groups ranging from 6-year-olds to teenagers of over 18 years old. The raised funds were utilized to purchase notebooks, masks, sanitizers, stationery, and a few snacks for the children and other necessary information regarding the donations was provided to the donors to maintain privacy. These kids have faced numerous struggles in their early lives, and INARA hopes to provide them with a better life ahead by supporting the children in future.

2.3 Donations for study materials:
In February and March 2021, Inara raised funds through donations of study materials for a foundling home. Several people volunteered to deliver the donations and had a wonderful time spending time with the kids there. The children were provided with books, notebooks, and some stationery items, all purchased with the donations made by kind-hearted supporters and some of our volunteers. Our only motive was to support the children and bring smiles to their faces. We intend to make more such contributions in the future, as much as possible.

2.4 Balram Bastia:
We at Inara believe in taking steps that will not only bring effective change in our society and environment but also help those in need. To aid, we came up with fundraising projects to raise funds for collective and individual projects. One of our projects was to raise funds for Balram Bastia, a divyang cricketer from Odisha Divyang Cricketers Association (ODCA), who unfortunately had a bent leg due to polio. Despite this, he never gave up on his dream to play cricket at higher levels. To help him keep up with his practice and better performance for qualifying for the Ranji Trophy, new cricket gear was required, for which we began a fundraiser. This was the first fundraiser Inara had ever organized, and with the support of our volunteers and others, we were able to buy Balram a new pair of cricket pads. This gesture brought immense happiness to him, and he has already started his training and practice for the Ranji Trophy

2.5 RK Panda
In October 2021, RK Panda, a family man who was the sole earning member of his household, was involved in an accident that left him in critical condition. He was immediately admitted to SCB Hospital in Cuttack, where it was discovered that he had multiple fractures in his right leg and shoulder. Due to the severity of his injuries, he underwent multiple surgeries, with one critical surgery left to be performed on his leg. However, he was struggling financially and had no fixed employment, making it challenging for him to afford the necessary equipment and medicines for his treatment. Inara stepped in to help by raising funds to cover some of the costs.

After a few days, he underwent the final surgery and began to heal well. Inara is grateful to have been able to assist him and bring a smile to his face.

3. Collaboration Projects

3.1 Revive Similipal
In 2021, one of the largest forest fires was seen in the Similipal region of Odisha, which is home to a large variety of flora and fauna. This includes 94 species of orchids, 55 species of mammals, 304 species of birds, 60 species of reptiles, 21 species of amphibians, 38 species of fish, and 164 species of butterflies. In order to contribute to undoing the damage, Inara collaborated with Youth for Sustainability on the ‘Revive Similipal’ project. The project had a five-way strategy for five months, aimed at planting 5000 trees in 30+ villages and working with local authorities to set up a no-forest fire committee. This was carried out through a week-long immersion trip to Similipal carried out by Youth for Sustainability, India.

3.2 Pran-E:
“E” from Pran-E stands for the “electronic medium,” which is a virtual fundraiser used to help animals. Pran-E is a voice for the unheard.

As an organization with the goal of giving back to society, we believe that no one’s voice should go unheard, stomachs should not go hungry, and health should not be ignored. Hence, Inara has made it a regular affair to visit animal shelters like PFA and contribute to the upkeep of our animal friends through fundraising.

3.3 Clean Beach India:
During June of 2022, Inara collaborated with Youth for Sustainability during their yearly megaproject – Clean Beach India. The project had volunteers clean six beaches across Odisha and Andhra Pradesh simultaneously. Not only that, but it also included coming up with a long-term plan to involve the government and the local communities in maintaining the cleanliness of the sixth-largest coastline. Inara has always realized its responsibility towards Mother Earth and continues to contribute to its betterment through its community.

3.4 Environment Day:
Inara collaborated with Youth for Sustainability’s – Xavier’s Law School and School of Commerce, Bhubaneswar chapters to celebrate Environment Day on June 5th by conducting an art competition on the environment at a foundling home based in Bhubaneswar. The volunteers interacted with the children at the foundling home and helped them learn more about the environment.

3.5 Daan Utsav:
Inara partnered with the Bakul Foundation for their bi-yearly Daan Utsav, where one of the mottos was “Gift a child her first book”. They distributed books to children in slums and villages through crowdfunding, providing them with their first-ever book. The campaign was launched on World Literacy Day in September 2022. Inara’s volunteers were also part of Bakul’s Day of Service, interacting with the children, playing games, creating arts and crafts together, and sharing stories. They took away memories and smiles from the experience.

3.6 Collaboration with NSS Cell of XIM University:
During the collaboration with the NSS cell of XIM University for Pran-E, students of the NSS cell and volunteers from INARA visited the PFA animal shelter on October, 2022 and again on January 2023 to look out for and gain some insights about our non-human friends at the shelter. The shelter has stray dogs, cats, cows, buffaloes, a horse, and rabbits, among others. Most of them were rescued from different parts of the state and are all taken care of at PFA by a bunch of hard-working volunteers and supervisors.

4. Virtual Projects

4.1 Small Business Project:
Every individual has an inner entrepreneur waiting to be discovered. It is crucial to support these budding entrepreneurs by providing motivation, guidance, and assistance throughout their journey to help them grow their businesses. Inara recognized the importance of supporting small, local businesses and encouraged others to do the same. By buying from local businesses, you not only stimulate the local economy, but you also help families earn a living. Supporting small businesses is crucial for the environment as they have a smaller carbon footprint than larger companies. Thus, we created “The Small Business Project,” where we regularly showcase products from interested businesses on our social media platforms. It was heartening to see the enthusiasm of these budding entrepreneurs and their unique ideas, ranging from upcycled waste to delicious food and accessories. We are proud to contribute to the growth of such amazing businesses and glad that the small businesses joined us on our second-year anniversary.

4.2 Pride Month:
For every human being, it is very important to accept who they are. Accepting oneself in its entirety brings a person at peace with oneself and helps them lead a life with pride. People often remain confused about their sexual orientation due to lack of awareness, lack of parental support, social stigma, peer pressure, and many other reasons. This is why they are looked down upon and humiliated. It is essential to be aware and confident in your own identity to stand strong with your head held high to survive in such an indifferent society.

Thus, Inara took the initiative to bring awareness among people about sexual orientation and came up with the project of “The Pride Month”, which was hosted by Inara’s volunteers. Each volunteer had to choose a flag representing different communities while spreading awareness about the same via posting pictures and handmade artwork showing support for such communities. We were overwhelmed to see the responses we had received from people who came across our posts and realized our work and efforts. Moreover, we were happy to see that people were able to identify their identity and become familiar with it. We at Inara take pride in celebrating different communities.

4.3 The Happiness Project:
The past years have been very difficult for every individual across the globe due to the pandemic. While the pandemic took over the globe in its entirety, and people were forced to stay back at home, maintaining social distancing, Inara came up with a virtual project with the aim of maintaining balance in tough times, supporting the needy to get through the time, keeping them close enough to enjoy the time granted in disguise of a pandemic and making a positive difference in their lives.

Inara conducted The Happiness Project virtually for 10 days with participants performing 10 tasks each day. The project started with a positive task of writing a letter for their future selves. The next challenge was to create a combined playlist by sharing their two favourite songs. Participants then shared stories of something that brought them happiness through photos in “Love in a Photography”. The following challenge was to push their limits and face their fears with “Out of Comfort Zone”. “Connect & Reconnect” encouraged making new connections and reconnecting with old friends. Participants were then challenged to clean or redecorate their living space in “Clean Your Space”. “Exercise & Meditation” focused on physical and mental health. In “Let’s Cook Today”, participants cooked and shared a dish. “Day of Gratitude” encouraged acts of kindness. The project ended with “Let’s Get Crafty”, where participants created art or DIY projects. Due to the positive feedback, The Happiness Project 2.0 was conducted in 2022 with similar projects and twists.

5. Creative Fundraisers
5.1 ZUMBA FOR A PURPOSE:
Inara Foundation recently hosted a remarkable event, “Zumba for a Purpose,” that beautifully combined fitness and philanthropy. Over 30 enthusiastic individuals came together for an energizing Zumba session, guided by the dynamic Zumba instructor, Shiva sir. This session wasn’t just about dancing; it was a meaningful step towards making a difference.
Participants paid a nominal fee of Rs.50 to join the Zumba extravaganza. However, the significance of their contribution extended far beyond a mere workout. All the proceeds collected from the event will be channeled into purchasing essential medications and nourishing food for animals residing in shelters.

WHY JOIN US ?
HEALTHY WORKING ENVIRONMENT: At Inara, we place significant emphasis on the well-being of our volunteers, both mentally and physically. We recognize and appreciate that there may be times when our volunteers require personal space and are unable to actively participate. Additionally, we promote the significance of mental and physical health through initiatives such as “The Happiness Project,” which is highlighted on our projects page.
LEADERSHIP: By volunteering at Inara, individuals can enhance their leadership abilities and cultivate independence through involvement in various projects. As volunteers, they can take charge and oversee these initiatives, providing them with opportunities to learn, lead, and develop simultaneously.
FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE: Inara adheres to and respects the true essence of volunteering, which is meant to be flexible for all volunteers and adaptable to their personal and professional schedules, without imposing any stress or pressure on them.
NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES: Inara offers a platform for our volunteers to enhance their networking skills and expand their personal and professional opportunities by interacting with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Our youth-oriented project, Acoinitier, is a popular program under our umbrella, where new connections are established as people engage with others.
TEAMWORK: Volunteering at Inara encourages teamwork, community, and a sense of belonging. Our volunteers are empowered to contribute to ongoing projects and are encouraged to share their perspectives. This fosters mutual understanding and cooperation within the group, leading to overall growth and development of individuals, groups, and ultimately Inara as a whole.
DIVERSITY: Volunteering at Inara offers volunteers the chance to collaborate with individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, thereby promoting and fostering a more comprehensive understanding of how the world operates. Moreover, we provide an excellent opportunity to embrace diversity, learn from different cultures and beliefs, and develop a broader understanding of the world.
PERSONAL GROWTH: Participating in different projects conducted by the organization can help individuals in recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, leading to personal development that includes effective communication, perspective-taking, and broadening one’s mental horizons, among other aspects.
SENSE OF SATISFACTION: Upon completion of a project, when a volunteer has dedicated their time and effort towards its success and positively impacted at least one person’s life, an immense sense of satisfaction and happiness is felt. Such emotions cannot be replicated or attained through any other means.
Lastly, volunteering is not just about completing tasks, but about the connections and impacts made along the way. The moment when a volunteer sees the impact of their work on someone’s life, whether it be a smile, a hug, or a simple thank you, is truly priceless. It reminds them of the reason they started volunteering in the first place and ignites a passion to continue making a difference in the world. The sense of fulfilment that comes with this feeling is unparalleled, and it stays with the volunteer for a long time.

In conclusion, volunteering is not only about contributing to a project but also about the joy that comes with making a positive difference in someone’s life. The sense of satisfaction and happiness that one experiences from this is truly special and cannot be matched by any other means.

And that is why, US.
