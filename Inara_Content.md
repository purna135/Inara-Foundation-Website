## WHAT WE DO

> *We believe no cause is too small, and no impact is too distant.*

At **Inara**, we are a collective movement for holistic welfare, turning
compassion into real change.\
From supporting underprivileged children and caring for vulnerable
animals to protecting the environment and empowering local
entrepreneurs, we work hand in hand with diverse communities to create
sustainable progress.

We don't just advocate for change --- **we make it happen.**

Together, we're building a kinder, stronger, and more compassionate
world.

## ABOUT US

### Core

**Inara** is a youth-led non-profit organization based in Bhubaneswar,
India, where compassion transforms into meaningful change through
community upliftment and volunteering initiatives.

We founded Inara to bridge the systematic gap between underserved
communities and vulnerable animals, creating a space where empathy meets
action.\
Our work is structured, transparent, and holistic --- driven by
passionate youth who believe in making compassion visible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Origin Story

What began as **Sweta's passion project** with a few friends has grown
into Inara --- a ray of joy, support, and hope for the underprivileged.

Her simple wish to help children sparked Inara's first steps four years
ago. From collecting donations for orphanages to expanding into diverse
community projects, Inara has always listened closely to people's needs,
prioritizing safety, care, and compassion above all.

Each small act made a real difference, inspiring new initiatives and
drawing more volunteers to the cause. *What started as me soon became
we.*

Under Sweta's heartfelt leadership, ideas continue to turn into action,
empowering every project with her vision, dedication, and grace.
Together, this growing community laid the foundation for Inara as a
credible **Section 8 company**, driven by purpose and compassion.

## OUR VISION & MISSION

## ORGANISATIONAL OVERVIEW

Inara was officially incorporated as a **Section 8 Non-Profit
Organisation** in India on *4th January 2023*, reinforcing our
commitment to institutional credibility, financial integrity, and
transparency for every donor, volunteer, and collaborator.

As a Section 8 platform, we are dedicated to executing high-impact
programs in community upliftment and animal welfare, ensuring every

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WHAT IS A SECTION 8 NON-PROFIT ORGANISATION?

A **Section 8 Company** is registered under the *Indian Companies Act,
2013* and operates to promote charitable objectives such as education,
art, culture, and social welfare.

All profits generated are legally reinvested into the organisation's
charitable goals --- ensuring that every action is driven by social
impact, not private gain.

Section 8 companies enjoy legal recognition and credibility, which helps
in building trust with donors, volunteers, and partners.

This status allows organisations like Inara to collaborate with
government bodies and other NGOs more effectively.\
It also enhances the organisation's ability to raise funds and attract
support for long-term social initiatives.
